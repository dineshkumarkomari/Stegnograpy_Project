# Stegnograpy_Project
This project involves designing and implementing a steganography application using Python, with a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The system enables users to securely hide and extract secret information (e.g., text) within digital images, ensuring data privacy and imperceptibility.
The application uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique for embedding data, preserving the image quality while keeping the hidden information secure. The user-friendly GUI allows easy interaction for encoding and decoding processes, making it accessible to non-technical users.
Key Features:

Data Embedding:
Allows users to select an image and hide a secret message within it using the LSB method.
Data Extraction:
Retrieves the hidden message from the stego-image accurately.
Tkinter GUI:
Provides an intuitive interface for uploading images, entering secret messages, and saving the output images.
Error Handling:
Includes features to ensure valid inputs and manage corrupted or incompatible images.
Data Security:
Optionally integrates encryption to add an extra layer of protection for hidden messages.
Tools & Technologies:

Programming Language: Python
GUI Library: Tkinter
Image Processing: Pillow (PIL)
This project is ideal for learning data hiding techniques and GUI development, offering a practical tool for secure communication.

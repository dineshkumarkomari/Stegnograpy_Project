# Stegnograpy_Project
This project involves designing and implementing a steganography application using Python, with a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The system enables users to securely hide and extract secret information (e.g., text) within digital images, ensuring data privacy and imperceptibility.
The application uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique for embedding data, preserving the image quality while keeping the hidden information secure. The user-friendly GUI allows easy interaction for encoding and decoding processes, making it accessible to non-technical users.


#Tools & Technologies:

Programming Language: Python 

GUI Library: Tkinter 

Image Processing: Pillow (PIL) .

This project is ideal for learning data hiding techniques and GUI development, offering a practical tool for secure communication.
